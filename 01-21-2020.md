Continuing from my previous [blog post]("https://dev.to/danvyle/javascript-fundamentals-101-cont-d-3nh"), more javascript 101 questions!:



## Module Patterns

**Modules** are an integral piece of any robust application's architecture and typically help in keeping the units of code for a project both cleanly separated and organized. The Module Pattern is great for services and testing/TDD.

The **Module pattern** was originally defined as a way to provide both private and public encapsulation for classes in conventional software engineering. This helps reduce the chance of having conflicting function names with other functions in your code.

Before ES6, modules looked similar to this, stating private variables first, `return`ing variables to make them public and then immediately invoking them at the end with `()` at the bottom.

```javascript
(function() {

    // declare private variables and/or functions

    return {
        //declare public variables and/or functions
    }
  }

})();
```

After ES6, modules have been created to be accessible in classes in other files. private properties are established in the constructor and public methods are still below being `return`ed. The class is created and you can export the class. It can then be imported in any other files for use. FreeCodeCamp has a great example of this:

```javascript
//lib/module.js file
class ShoppingDataType {
  constructor() {
    //private Properties
    this.shoppingList = ['bananas', 'oranges', 'apples']
  }

  // public methods
  getShoppingList() {
    return this.shoppingList.join(", ")
  }

  addItem(item) {
    this.shoppingList.push(item)
  }
}

export default ShoppingDataType;

// main.js file

import ShoppingDataType from 'lib/module';

var shopping = new ShoppingDataType;
console.log(shopping.getShoppingList());
```

There are many schools of thought on how to design your code in javascript and module patterns is just one. [Click here for more information on other design patterns]("https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#designpatternsjavascript")
