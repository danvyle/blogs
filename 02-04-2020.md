## More JavaScript Questions 101(MJSQ 101): 

Continuing from my original [blog post]("https://dev.to/danvyle/more-javascript-fundamentals-101-4d5d"), more javascript 101 questions!:

## Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`. What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?

First you'll need to understand what an IIFE is. An **IIFE** (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.

```javascript  
(function () {
    var whoWonSuperBowl = "Kansas City Chiefs";
    return whoWonSuperBowl;
})();

//output: "Kansas City Chiefs"

```
`function foo() {} ();` is reading the two as separate: `function foo(){}` as a function declaration and then `()` as a function call. Since they are not grouped, the function throws an error: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token`. 

To fix this, we can call on the grouping operator `( )` to group the function declaration and immediately invoke the function `(function foo(){ })()` or group the entire function together with `(function foo(){ }())` to create function expressions that can be immediately invoked.

## What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?

IIFE which was mentioned above:

```javascript
    (function() {
        //expression
    })();
```
As a callback where naming the function isn't necessary and it won't need to be used anywhere else(Yangshun's example):

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}, 1000);
```

## What's the difference between host objects and native objects?

**Native objects** are objects that are unique to the JavaScript language. Some examples include: String, Number, Array, Image, Date, Math, etc.

**Host objects** are objects that are supplied to JavaScript by the browser environment. Examples of these are window, document, forms, etc.

That's all for today, please leave any comments/questions/corrections in the comments. Thanks!

Huge huge thanks to github user: yangshun for aggregating the most popular JS, CSS and HTML questions and giving us his answers to it. My weekly blog posts are to go over several questions at a time to reinforce my knowledge of fundamental javascript as I grow my expertise in it. Many of my blog will be paraphrasing if not direct quote from his github. Find his tech interview handbook [here]("https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook/blob/master/questions/javascript-questions.md#whats-the-difference-between-call-and-apply") and please support him!

And an additional thank you to Flatiron alum: Marissa O. who is a badass developer at Forbes magazine for directing me to his blog!
