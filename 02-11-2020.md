## More JavaScript Questions 101(MJSQ 101): 

Continuing from my original [blog post]("https://dev.to/danvyle/more-javascript-fundamentals-101-4d5d"), I give you more javascript 101 questions!:


Today's blog will be dedicated to answering how `this` works.

`this` can produce many different results and a lot of it is case dependent. Because you're in the world of JS, a great way to determine what `this` is, is to `console.log(this)` to check. BUT, if you want to understand the background work that is happening, please read on.

Arnav Aggarwal has a great blog explaining how `this` works. Much of the examples below are taken directly from his blog. 

The highest rule of all is that `this` is determined when a function is invoked (it's **call site**) The remaining rules in order of precedence is showcased below:

1. If `new` keyword is used when calling a function,  `this` is a brand new object. 

```js 
function forExample() {
    console.log(this);
    this.value = "football";
    console.log(this);
}

new forExample();
//output: {}
//output: {value: 'football}
```

2. If `apply`, `call`, or `bind` are used to call a function, `this` inside the function is the object(in this case, `touchdown`) that is passed in as the argument.

```js 
function score() {
    console.log(this);
}
var touchdown = {
    value: 6
};
var bindscore = score.bind(touchdown);
bindscore();     // output: -> { value: 6 }
score.call(touchdown);  // output:  { value: 6 }
score.apply(touchdown); // -> output: { value: 6 }
```
3. If a function is called as a method, `this` is the object. When a dot is to the left of the function invoked, `this` is the object to the left of the dot.

```js

var obj = {
    value: 6,
    printThis: function() {
        console.log(this);
    }
};

obj.printThis(); 
//output: {value: 5, printThis: function()}
```

4. If a function is invoked as a **free function invocation**, (global), `this` is the global object. In a browser, it's the `window`.

```js
function fn() {
    console.log(this);
}
// If called in browser:
fn(); // output: Window {stop: ƒ, open: ƒ, alert: ƒ, ...}
```

To note: If multiple scenarios exist, the order of the previous mentioned conditions are important in establishing `this`.

5. If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, all rules are thrown out the window. To determine `this`, go a line above the arrow function's creation and see what `this` is there. It will be the same in the arrow function.

```js
const obj = {
    value: 'Chiefs win superbowl.',
    createArrowFn: function() {
        return () => console.log(this);
    }
};
const arrowFn = obj.createArrowFn();
arrowFn(); 
// output: { value: 'Chiefs win superbowl.', createArrowFn: ƒ }

```

If the new keyword is used when calling the function, this inside the function is a brand new object.
If apply, call, or bind are used to call/create a function, this inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument.
If a function is called as a method, such as obj.method() — this is the object that the function is a property of.
If a function is invoked as a free function invocation, meaning it was invoked without any of the conditions present above, this is the global object. In a browser, it is the window object. If in strict mode ('use strict'), this will be undefined instead of the global object.
If multiple of the above rules apply, the rule that is higher wins and will set the this value.
If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, it ignores all the rules above and receives the this value of its surrounding scope at the time it is created.

Can you give an example of one of the ways that working with this has changed in ES6?
ES6 allows you to use arrow functions which uses the enclosing lexical scope. This is usually convenient, but does prevent the caller from controlling context via .call or .apply—the consequences being that a library such as jQuery will not properly bind this in your event handler functions. Thus, it's important to keep this in mind when refactoring large legacy applications.

My weekly blog posts are to go over several questions at a time to reinforce my knowledge of fundamental javascript as I grow my expertise in it. Many of my blog will be paraphrasing if not direct quote from his github. Find his tech interview handbook [here]("https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook/blob/master/questions/javascript-questions.md#whats-the-difference-between-call-and-apply") and please support him!
