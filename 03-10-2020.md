## More JavaScript Questions 101(MJSQ 101): 
Continuing from my original [blog post]("https://dev.to/danvyle/more-javascript-fundamentals-101-4d5d"), I give you more javascript 101 questions answered!:

Let's tackle another easy quick algorithm question this week:
## Make this work:  `duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]`]



#### The solution:
```js

function duplicate(arr) {
    return arr.concat(arr)
}

console.log(duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))

//output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

#### What do we know:
It looks like the input is `[1,2,3,4,5]` and the desired output is `[1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]`.
It also looks like it's calling a function duplicate() to make this work.
We also know of a quick array method that can add one array onto another, it's called concat()

Here's an example:

```js

var arr = [8, 6, 7]
arr.concat[5, 3, 0, 9]

//output: [8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9]

```

#### Pseudocode:
* So we would need to write the `function` 
* and call it `duplicate(arr)` 
* so that it could take an argument, such as an array of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` 
* and work with the `concat()` array method to add the original array to itself. 
* We would then return `arr.concat(arr)` 
* so that when we display the output or `console.log()the function, 
* the output will give you the input twice in a new array: `[1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]`

Here's the solution again in case you are one of those models that can only scroll down.

```js

function duplicate(arr) {
    return arr.concat(arr)
}

console.log(duplicate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))

//output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```
