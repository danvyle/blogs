## More JavaScript Questions 101(MJSQ 101): 
Continuing from my original [blog post]("https://dev.to/danvyle/more-javascript-fundamentals-101-4d5d"), I give you more javascript 101 questions answered!:

Question this week:
## Explain Function.prototype.bind

Taken word-for-word from MDN:

The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.


```js
const module = {
  x: 42,
  getX: function() {
    return this.x;
  }
}

const unboundGetX = module.getX;
console.log(unboundGetX()); // The function gets invoked at the global scope
// expected output: undefined

const boundGetX = unboundGetX.bind(module);
console.log(boundGetX());
// expected output: 42


```
In their example, the unboundGetX variable cannot call on the module variable's getX function until it has been bound with the Function.prototype.bind method.

This approach would be good when you're wanting to bind the value of `this` to pass into other functions.

My weekly blog posts are to go over several questions at a time to reinforce my knowledge of fundamental javascript as I grow my expertise in it. Many of my blog will be paraphrasing if not direct quotes from his github.
