### JavaScript Fundamentals 101: Scope and Closures

### Scopes

**Scope** refers to where variables and functions are accessible, and in what context it is being executed. Basically, a variable or function can be defined in a global or local scope. Variables have so-called function scope, and functions have the same scope as variables.

**Global Scope** is when a declared variable can be accessible by anywhere inside your code.

```javascript

var wideReceiver = "DK Metcalf!"; //This variable is available due to global scope
function playerSighting () {
console.log("Look! " + wideReceiver);
}

playerSighting(); //output: "Look! DK Metcalf!"

```

**Local Scope** is when a variable is only available inside the function in which it was declared.

```javascript

function playerSighting () {
var wideReceiver = "DK Metcalf!";
return alert(wideReceiver);
}
alert(wideReceiver); //  ReferenceError: wideReceiver is not defined

//Because its scope is local, it will throw an error
```

It is also worth noting that nested functions on the same level will also have access to one another, Robert Nyman provides a good example:

```javascript
function siblings () {
  var siblings = ["John", "Liza", "Peter"];
  function siblingCount () {
    var siblingsLength = siblings.length;
    return siblingsLength;
}
  function joinSiblingNames () {
    return "I have " + siblingCount() + " siblings:\n\n" + siblings.join("\n");
}
  return joinSiblingNames();
}
alert(siblings()); // Outputs "I have 3 siblings: John Liza Peter"
```

### Closures

 A **closure** is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. In other words, a **closure** gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.


Consider this example:

```javascript

function footballPlay() {
  var quarterBack = "Russell Wilson";
    function runPlay() { //runPlay is the function inside the function aka inner function aka closure
      console.log(quarterBack + ", give it to Beast Mode."); // it's using the variable from outside the inner function
    }
    runPlay();
  }


footballPlay(); // output: Russell Wilson, give it to Beast Mode.

```

Here's another more intricate example given by Mozilla documentation:

```javascript

function makeAdder(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}

var add5 = makeAdder(5); // a closure
var add10 = makeAdder(10); //also a closure

console.log(add5(2));  // 7
console.log(add10(2)); // 12
```

add5 and add10 are both closures. They provide different lexical environments within the same function. One adds 5 to the makeAdder function, one adds 10 to the makeAdder function.

Hope this helps you understand scopes and closures better, please let me know if you have any comments/additions!
